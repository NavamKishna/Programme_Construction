You are required to develop a software program that will simulate a swimming competition. The simulation contains a swimming pool that has 5 swim lanes. It also has a pavilion. There are swimmers, spectators, judges and supporting staff. Swimmers should be distinguished as male and female â€“ males wear blue and females wear red.  Every person in the simulation has a unique name.  When the judge blows the whistle, the competition is started and the players start swimming. Once they reach the other end of the pool, they have finished the game. They need to touch a touch pad at this finishing end. Each touch pad then notifies the finishing time to a score board. The score board compares these finishing times, and identifies the order of finishing. This information is then displayed in the score board.

You are required to develop a software program that will simulate a swimming competition. In the simulation, there are swimmers, spectators, judges and supporting staff. They all have a name, and an id number. They all can check the scoreboard. In addition, swimmers can swim, and judges can blow the whistle.  Number of objects to be created for swimmers, spectators, etc should be able to be given in as command-line arguments.
